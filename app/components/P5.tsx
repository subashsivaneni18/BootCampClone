        Hello, I am Flavio Copes. You may know me from my blog flaviocopes.com,
        my free programming ebooks on thevalleyofcode.com, or my freeCodeCamp
        contributions. I have been organizing this Bootcamp every year since
        2020. I am 39 years old, Italian. I graduated in computer engineering
        from Politecnico di Milano in 2008. My passion for computers dates back
        to the 1980s. I have been a Linux fan since 1998, a Mac enthusiast since
        2005, bought my first JavaScript book in 1998, and consider myself a
        professional JavaScript developer since 2012.
        <br />
        <p>
          Just a few words to let you know I&apos;m serious about these things.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>My mission is to help you become a Web Developer.</p>
