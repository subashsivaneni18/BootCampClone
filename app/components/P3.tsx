        It&apos;s 100% practice-based. We&apos;ll build an awesome project using
        a fantastic full-stack tech stack: Astro, htmx, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS,
        Pocketbase. Perfect to learn how to code from scratch. Perfect if
        you&apos;re into Web Dev but you&apos;re a bit rusty. Perfect if

        devops, ...) and you want to transition to Web Development. Perfect to
        learn how to create your own SaaS. This is not &quot;just a
        course&quot;. It&apos;s a once-a-year event designed with one goal in
        mind:
